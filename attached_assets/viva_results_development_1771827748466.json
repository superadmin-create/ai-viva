Let's begin with the first question.\nUser: Okay.\nAI: What is technical analysis, and how does it differ from fundamental analysis in evaluating stock performance?\nUser: Technical analysis is basically evaluating the previous chart price moment and expecting the future stock moment. However, fundamental analysis is understanding the financial data of a company which includes balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and also evaluating the cash flow statement of the company. Thank you.\nAI: Thank you, Josh. Let's move to the next question. How would you use moving averages to identify potential buy or sell signals in a stock's price chart?\nUser: I don't know the answer for this.\nAI: That's okay. Let's move to the next question. Imagine a stock has been consistently declining. What technical indicators would you analyze to determine if it might reverse its trend?\nUser: I will use RSI if it goes below thirty and then it gives a reversal. That is an indication to buy a down trending stock. I can also use MACD crossover to buy a stock.\nAI: Thank you, Josh. Now for the next question. Compare and contrast the effectiveness of chart patterns versus indicators in technical analysis. Which do you believe is more reliable and why?\nUser: I believe chart pattern are much more believable since they are maybe tried and tested, and it has been seen in multiple previous cases as well, which is why it is widely used for trading for technical analysis.\nAI: Alright. Thank you. Now for the final question. In a real world scenario where a company announces unexpected bad news, how would technical analysis help you assess the impact on its stock price?\nUser: Technical analysis usually does not help in such fundamental triggers.\nAI: Thank you, Josh Vora, for completing this Viva. You may now end the session. Good luck.\n","recording_url":"https://storage.vapi.ai/019c4c6e-5289-7eeb-bc31-018583af4ebe-1770809000781-c7924a2c-6765-487a-b51a-50cde5871889-mono.wav","evaluation":{"depth":65,"clarity":70,"knowledge":75,"strengths":["Good understanding of fundamental vs technical analysis","Ability to identify relevant indicators"],"improvements":["Expand on moving averages and their implications","Enhance clarity in comparing methodologies"]},"created_at":"2026-02-12T14:06:39.041Z","vapi_call_id":null,"teacher_email":"jash.vora@leapup.in","marks_breakdown":[{"marks":8,"answer":"Technical analysis involves evaluating past stock price movements to predict future ones, while fundamental analysis focuses on financial data like balance sheets and cash flows.","feedback":"Solid differentiation provided, but could include more details on implications of each approach.","maxMarks":10,"question":"What is technical analysis, and how does it differ from fundamental analysis in evaluating stock performance?","questionNumber":1},{"marks":0,"answer":"I don't know the answer for this.","feedback":"Unable to answer this question, which is a key component of technical analysis.","maxMarks":10,"question":"How would you use moving averages to identify potential buy or sell signals in a stock's price chart?","questionNumber":2},{"marks":7,"answer":"I will use RSI if it goes below thirty and MACD crossover for buying.","feedback":"Good identification of indicators, but could provide more detail on how they signal changes.","maxMarks":10,"question":"Imagine a stock has been consistently declining.
