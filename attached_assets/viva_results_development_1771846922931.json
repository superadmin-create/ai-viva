Phaya's partywala. Welcome to your Viva examination for machine learning. I'll be asking you some questions. Take your time to think before answering. Let's begin. Question one. Can you explain the key differences between regression and classification in supervised learning?\nUser: Regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes while classification is used for predicting categorical outcomes. The choice between them depends on the nature of the target variable.\nAI: Thank you for your answer. Now for the second question, describe a real world scenario where supervised learning could be applied to improve decision making. What algorithms would you consider and why?\nUser: Example is predicting customer churn in a subscription service, algorithms like logistic regression or random forest can be used due to the interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.\nAI: Alright. Thank you. Moving on to the third question, how would you approach a situation where your supervised learning model is overfitting? What techniques could you apply to mitigate this issue?\nUser: To address overfitting, I would consider techniques like regularization, reducing the complexity of the model or cross validation. Additionally, gathering more data can help improve generalizations.\nAI: Thank you for your response. Now for the fourth question, compare and contrast supervised learning with unsupervised learning. In what scenarios might one be preferred over the other?\nUser: Always learning uses labeled data for training, while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns. Supervised learning is preferred when the outcome is known, while unsupervised is useful for exploratory analysis.\nAI: Thank you for your answer, finally. For the fifth question, imagine you are tasked with predicting housing prices in a city. What steps would you take to develop a supervised learning model for this task?\nUser: Start by collecting relevant data, example location, size, number of bedrooms, reprocess the data, handle with the missing values and normalization, choose appropriate features, select a model like linear regression, then evaluate the model, and finally test the performance on unseen data.\nAI: Thank you. Fayas Partywala for completing this Viva. You may now end the session. Good luck\n","recording_url":"https://storage.vapi.ai/019c898d-3a1d-7112-9ca6-21522563b517-1771834450913-969bb862-b24c-45ff-9b7a-192aab9dd359-mono.wav","evaluation":{"depth":85,"clarity":80,"knowledge":90,"strengths":["Strong understanding of concepts","Proper use of terminology"],"improvements":["Improve clarity of explanations","Provide more examples in answers"]},"created_at":"2026-02-23T08:18:46.520Z","vapi_call_id":"019c898d-3a1d-7112-9ca6-21522563b517","teacher_email":"","marks_breakdown":[{"marks":8,"answer":"Regression predicts continuous outcomes, classification predicts categorical outcomes.","feedback":"Good identification of the core differences; however, more detail regarding specific use cases could enhance the answer.","maxMarks":10,"question":"Can you explain the key differences between regression and classification in supervised learning?","questionNumber":1},{"marks":9,"answer":"Predicting customer churn in a subscription service; algorithms like logistic regression or random forest.","feedback":"Excellent example and rationale for algorithm choice, demonstrates practical application.","maxMarks":10,"question":"Describe a real world scenario where supervised learning could be applied to improve decision making.
